**contents**
* sql query that will solve the nostrum hack by making nostrum skills learned above the maximum server level
* ct files that help solve issues with rune skill cutting, the skill cooldown exploit, and prevent the stealth exploit
* ct file that will allow rangers and sins to use skills from stealth like they are able to in newer episodes
* ct file that corrects the bug of prior ranking battle points stacking with the current ranking battle points
* game.exe with antifreeze and exploit solutions

**server**
* complete ep3 server files for client version 40 that are vastly improved but not flawless (thanks, ZeroSignal)
* ps_game that runs without the gameguard dlls and cauth config files
* ps_db_Agent that has been edited to match lilprohacker's packet-based dupe solution (needs testing)
* ps_login is the same one available in the parent directory

**notes**
* execute remove apostrophes, nostrum hack solution, and no enchant or oj after mass skill and item updates
* all ep3 client sdata files must be decrypted
